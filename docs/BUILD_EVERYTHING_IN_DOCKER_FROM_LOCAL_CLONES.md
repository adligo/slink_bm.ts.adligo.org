# Workflow 4) Build Everything in Docker From Local Clones

## TODO

##### Note:

This is an alternate way to do [work flow 1](./BUILD_EVERYTHING_LOCALLY.md), if it isn't working on your machine, or if you need some sort of a reproducible build environment for something like a test or trial of an AI coding tool.
